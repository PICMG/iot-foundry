# Architecture Overview

This page summarizes the IoTFoundry architecture and key components. Detailed diagrams and component pages are linked from the Architecture menu.

- Edge devices (microcontrollers): MCTP serial transport and optional PLDM handlers for device management.
- Host systems (e.g., Linux): MCTP userspace tools, test harnesses, and PLDM clients.
- Test & validation: host-driven test harnesses for protocol conformance and interoperability.

See `assets/images/architecture-diagram.svg` for a simple reference diagram.
