# Architecture Overview

This page summarizes the IoTFoundry architecture and key components and links to detailed pages that describe scope, use cases, the connection model, and reference materials.

- **Edge devices (microcontrollers):** MCTP serial transport and optional PLDM handlers for device management.
- **Host systems (Linux):** Kernel and userspace MCTP/PLDM components, enumeration tools, and test harnesses.
- **Test & validation:** Host-driven test harnesses for protocol conformance and interoperability.
