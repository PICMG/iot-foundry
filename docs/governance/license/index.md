Unless otherwise specified in a project's repository, IoTFoundry projects are licensed under the MIT No Attribution license (MIT-0). Individual projects may include their own `LICENSE` file that overrides this default for that specific project — always check the repository for project-specific licensing information.

For convenience, a copy of the repository root `LICENSE` is also available: `{{ '/LICENSE' | relative_url }}`.
