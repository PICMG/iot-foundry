Event-Driven Communication: "A feature that allows endpoints to send messages when triggered by a local event."
Firmware Update: "A method of applying firmware changes to endpoint devices."
GPIO: "General-Purpose Input/Output; a type of hardware control interface consisting of digital inputs and/or outputs."
Human-Machine Interface (HMI): "A user interface that allows technicians or administrators to interact with the system."
MCTP: "Management Component Transport Protocol; a lightweight communication protocol used to send messages between devices like microcontrollers and Linux systems."
PDR: "Platform Descriptor Record; a binary-encoded data structure that describes an endpoint’s capabilities, commands, and telemetry interfaces."
PLDM: "Platform Level Data Model; a protocol layered over MCTP that defines structured commands, responses, and data models for platform management."
Redfish: "A DMTF-defined RESTful API and schema for system-level management, extended for industrial IoT by PICMG."
Resource-Constrained Device: "A device with limited memory and processing power, such as a microcontroller, for which binary-encoded PDRs are optimized."
