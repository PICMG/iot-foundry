## About IoTFoundry

IoTFoundry coordinates architecture, governance, and reference guidance for projects that implement MCTP and PLDM in resource-constrained devices. This repository holds umbrella-level materials; implementation code is hosted in per-project repositories.

If you are new here, start with the Architecture and Governance sections.
